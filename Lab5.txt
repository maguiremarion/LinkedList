This program is my creation of a LinkedList. It defines the Node at the top and then has 6 methods:
1. add() adds a Node to the end of the LinkedList
2. add(pos) adds a Node to the LinkedList at an index of your choosing
3. get() returns a Node at a given index
4. remove() removes a Node at a given index
5. reverse() reverses a LinkedList and returns the head of the reversed list
6. show() prints the LinkedList in a viewable fashion
